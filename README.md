# DashBot
A currently WIP remake of the original DashBot to use the current Discord API.

The original version of DashBot was made in 2018, while I was still a high-school student learning how to code.
In recent years, Discord has made breaking changes to their API, and has begun killing a majority of popular music bots, making the need for these bots even greater.
Solutions exist as quick fixes, but I hope to remake DashBot as a personal bot to make up for the lack of other adaptable solutions.
